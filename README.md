# 🕌 Tasbeh

**Tasbeh** is a simple Flutter application designed to help users keep track of their tasbih (prayer beads) count. Every time the user presses the button, the counter increases, allowing them to easily keep track of their progress.

## ✨ Features

- **🔐 Login Screen**: Users are required to log in with their email and password. The app checks the credentials before granting access to the main counter screen.

- **🧮 Counter Screen**: The main screen of the app displays a tasbih counter:
  - A circular widget shows the current count of tasbih.
  - Users can press a button to increase the count by one.
  - Users can reset the counter to zero with a reset button.

- **🎨 Elegant UI**: The app features a clean and modern design with shadows and padding for a smooth user experience.

- **📱 Responsiveness**: The app layout is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
